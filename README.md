# 📊 Linear Regression

Welcome to the **Linear Regression** repository!  
This project demonstrates how to implement and analyze linear regression models using Python.

## 🚀 Overview

Linear regression is a foundational statistical technique used for modeling relationships between variables. This repository provides:

- Simple and multiple linear regression examples
- Data visualization techniques
- Model evaluation metrics
- Well-documented and easy-to-understand code

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `data/` — Sample datasets for regression tasks, the data included in this is from test scores and hours studied
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for experiments and visualization
- `src/` — Core Python scripts for modeling
- `README.md` — Project information and instructions

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** (100%)
- Libraries:  
  - NumPy  
  - Pandas  
  - Matplotlib  
  - Scikit-learn

## 🔥 Features

- Hands-on linear regression implementations
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Model training, testing, and performance evaluation
- Clean and modular codebase

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RadmehrVafadar/linear-Regression.git
cd linear-Regression

# (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
